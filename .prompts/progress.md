# Blackjack Trainer Refactoring Progress

## Date: June 14, 2025

### Initial Assessment
- Created refactoring plan in `.prompts/plan.md`
- Identified major areas for improvement:
  - Large hook refactoring
  - Project structure organization
  - Documentation improvements
  - TypeScript enhancements

### Progress Made
- Created React Context architecture to improve state management:
  - Added `BlackjackContext.tsx` with provider and custom hook
  - Structured the context to expose all needed game state and actions
- Refactored the large `useBlackjackGame` hook into smaller, more focused hooks:
  - Created `useGameState.ts` for managing the core game state
  - Created `useGameActions.ts` for handling game actions (hit, stand, etc.)
  - Created `useGameHistory.ts` for tracking game history and statistics
  - Implemented key functions like `newGameHandler`, `hitHandler`, etc.
- Reorganized project structure for better organization:
  - Created subdirectories in the `logic` folder: `game`, `strategy`, `utils`
  - Split types into logical groups: `cardTypes.ts`, `gameTypes.ts`, `historyTypes.ts`, etc.
  - Created an index.ts file to simplify imports
- Updated the App component to use the new BlackjackContext with proper provider pattern
- Added proper JSDoc comments to improve code documentation
- Improved project documentation:
  - Created a comprehensive README.md with project details, features, and usage instructions
  - Added ARCHITECTURE.md to document the design decisions and code organization
  - Added CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for future contributors
- Enhanced TypeScript usage:
  - Added proper interfaces for hook parameters
  - Added type annotations to callbacks and functions
  - Removed any implicit any types
- Updated all components to consume the BlackjackContext directly:
  - Updated `GameArea.tsx` to use context instead of props
  - Updated `Actions.tsx` to use context instead of props
  - Updated `HistoryModal.tsx` to use context instead of props
  - Updated `StrategyGuide.tsx` to use context instead of props
  - Updated `Card.tsx` to use the proper types from our new structure
  - Simplified `App.tsx` by removing prop passing
