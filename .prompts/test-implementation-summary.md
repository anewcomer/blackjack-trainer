# Test Implementation Summary

## Implemented Tests

We've successfully added the following tests to the Blackjack Trainer application:

### Utility Tests
- `blackjackUtils.test.ts`: Tests core utility functions including:
  - calculateHandValue
  - getHandScoreText
  - createNewDeck
  - shuffleDeck
  - dealOneCard

- `queryParamsUtils.test.ts`: Tests URL parameter handling for:
  - parseQueryParams
  - updateUrlWithGameState
  - shouldAutoPlayDealer

### Hook Tests
- `useGameActions.test.ts`: Tests game action hooks including:
  - newGameHandler
  - hitHandler
  - standHandler

### Component Tests
- `Card.test.tsx`: Tests the Card component in various states:
  - Regular cards
  - Hidden cards
  - Empty card slots
  - New cards with animations

- `GameArea.test.tsx`: Tests the GameArea component with:
  - Dealer and player areas
  - Actions visibility based on game state

### Context Tests
- `BlackjackContext.test.tsx`: Tests the context provider:
  - Providing state to components
  - Error handling outside provider

## Issues to Fix

Some tests are currently failing and need fixes:

1. **queryParamsUtils.test.ts**:
   - Mock URL parameters not being properly set
   - Test expectations need to match the actual implementation

2. **useGameActions.test.ts**:
   - Duplicate import in the main file causing Jest errors
   - Need to fix the mock setup

3. **Card.test.tsx**:
   - Incorrect mock for Framer Motion
   - ARIA role/label issues with test expectations

4. **GameArea.test.tsx**:
   - Actions component not being rendered or mocked correctly

## Next Steps

1. Fix the failing tests:
   - Update mock implementations
   - Adjust test expectations to match actual implementation
   - Fix component mocking

2. Add additional tests:
   - More component tests (HandArea, StatusMessage)
   - Additional hook tests (useGameHistory, useGameState)
   - Strategy calculation tests

3. Add integration tests:
   - Game flow testing
   - State transitions

4. Set up test coverage reporting to identify untested areas

5. Eventually add browser-based end-to-end tests
