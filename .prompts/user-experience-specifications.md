## Interface Design Principles

### 1. Immediate Feedback Loop
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded responses (green=correct, red=mistake)
- **Textual Feedback**: Clear messaging ("Correct: Stand" vs "Mistake! You: Hit, Optimal: Stand")
- **Strategy Integration**: Automatic highlighting of relevant strategy table cells
- **Timing**: Feedback appears within 100ms of action

### 2. Cognitive Load Reduction
- **Single Focus**: One decision at a time, clear current hand highlighting
- **Context Preservation**: Strategy reference always visible, no mental lookup required
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important elements (cards, actions) prominent, secondary info subtle
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features hidden until needed

### 3. Accessibility-First Design
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality available via keyboard shortcuts
- **Screen Reader Support**: Complete game state available via screen readers
- **High Contrast**: Clear visual distinctions work in all accessibility modes
- **Scalable Interface**: Text and buttons resize appropriately

### 4. Error Prevention
- **Disabled States**: Illegal actions disabled, preventing invalid moves
- **Clear Affordances**: Buttons clearly indicate their function with icons and text
- **Confirmation**: No accidental actions (New Game doesn't require confirmation as it's expected)
- **Undo Prevention**: No undo functionality to encourage thoughtful decisions

## Interaction Design Patterns

### 1. Card Dealing Animation
```
Sequence:
1. New Game clicked → Clear previous cards with fade out
2. Deck shuffle indication → Brief animation/sound
3. Player cards deal → Cards fly in from deck position
4. Dealer cards deal → Second card face down
5. Enable actions → Buttons become active with subtle highlight
```

### 2. Action Feedback Sequence
```
User Action:
1. Button click → Immediate button press animation
2. Card dealt (if applicable) → Smooth card animation from deck
3. Strategy evaluation → Background calculation
4. Feedback display → Color flash + message update
5. Strategy highlight → Table cell highlighted
6. Next action setup → Advance to next hand or dealer turn
```

### 3. Multi-Hand Management
```
Split Scenario:
1. Split button → Hands separate with animation
2. New cards dealt → One to each hand in sequence
3. Hand switching → Clear visual indication of active hand
4. Turn progression → Systematic left-to-right progression
5. Final resolution → All hands resolved before dealer
```

### 4. Dealer Turn Automation
```
Dealer Sequence:
1. Player actions complete → "Dealer's turn" message
2. Hole card reveal → Flip animation with slight delay
3. Dealer drawing → Cards dealt with realistic timing
4. Stand decision → Clear indication when dealer stops
5. Outcome calculation → All hands resolved simultaneously
```
