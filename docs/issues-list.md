# Issues List

This document lists known issues with the game, along with their status and any relevant notes. Whenever we start a new chat, consider the issues listed here as a starting point for items to address.

## Display Issues

The third column of the display area contains the following items:
- Session Statistics
- Mistake Patterns
- Game History

Instead, let's move the items into a second row below the row with the play area and the strategy guide area.

In the case of a narrow or mobile display, all five items should stack in a single column.
