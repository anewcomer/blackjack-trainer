# Blackjack Trainer - Development Progress

## Current Status
**Phase**: Foundation Setup â†’ Phase 2 (Core Game Logic)  
**Date**: June 21, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Ready to Test & Begin Phase 2

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] **Requirements Analysis**: Thoroughly reviewed all specification files
- [x] **Implementation Plan**: Created comprehensive `implementation-plan.md`
- [x] **Project Initialization**: React + TypeScript + MUI v7 + Redux Toolkit
- [x] **Redux Store Setup**: 
  - âœ… Store configuration with 3 slices (game, session, ui)
  - âœ… TypeScript interfaces for all state shapes
  - âœ… Typed hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector)
- [x] **Core Utilities Implementation**:
  - âœ… `cardUtils.ts` - Card manipulation, hand calculations, blackjack logic
  - âœ… `gameLogic.ts` - Game state management, action processing, outcome determination
  - âœ… `strategyEngine.ts` - Basic strategy evaluation and feedback
  - âœ… `constants.ts` - Game configuration and constants
- [x] **Static Data**: 
  - âœ… `strategyCharts.ts` - Complete basic strategy tables (Hard/Soft/Pairs)
- [x] **Theme Configuration**: 
  - âœ… `theme/index.ts` - Complete MUI theme with blackjack-specific colors and styling
- [x] **App Integration**:
  - âœ… Redux Provider and Theme Provider setup
  - âœ… Basic layout structure with GameLayout component
  - âœ… Placeholder GameArea and StrategyGuide components
  - âœ… Component organization with proper exports

### Infrastructure Quality
- âœ… **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper Redux typing
- âœ… **Code Organization**: Clean directory structure following implementation plan
- âœ… **Theme System**: Custom blackjack colors and strategy action styling
- âœ… **Component Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns (layout/game/strategy)

## Ready for Testing
The foundation is now complete and ready for the development server. All major systems are in place:

### âœ… What's Working
1. **Redux Store**: Complete state management foundation
2. **Type System**: Full TypeScript integration
3. **Utility Functions**: Core game logic ready for integration
4. **Theme System**: Professional styling with blackjack-specific design
5. **Component Structure**: Organized layout ready for feature implementation

### ðŸš§ What's Next (Phase 2)
1. **Test Foundation**: Run `npm start` to verify everything works
2. **Implement Card Components**: Visual card rendering with suits and ranks
3. **Game State Integration**: Connect utilities to Redux actions
4. **Basic Gameplay**: Implement deal, hit, stand functionality
5. **Hand Display**: Show player and dealer hands with proper calculations

## Development Server Ready
The project is now ready to run `npm start` and begin Phase 2 development with a solid foundation.
- **Testing Approach**: Unit tests for Redux + Integration tests for components + Limited E2E with Playwright
- **Development Workflow**: VSCode tasks for common operations to avoid user approval delays

## Files Created
- `docs/implementation-plan.md` - Comprehensive technical roadmap
- `docs/progress.md` - This progress tracking file

## Documentation Organization
All project documentation is organized in the `docs/` folder:
- **Specifications**: `functional-specifications.md`, `user-experience-specifications.md`, `minimal-requirements.md`
- **Development Guides**: `instructions.md`, `implementation-plan.md`
- **Progress Tracking**: `progress.md` (this file)
- **Future Documentation**: `decisions.md`, `issues.md`, `features.md` (to be created during development)

## Context Notes
- Emphasis on Redux reliability due to previous implementation challenges
- Focus on accessibility and responsive design from start
- GitHub Pages deployment requires specific package.json configuration
- Strategy evaluation and multi-hand splitting are most complex features requiring careful testing

## Blockers/Decisions Pending
None - ready to proceed with project initialization.
