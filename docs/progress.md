  - âœ… Proper action validation and available actions

### Phase 3: Strategy Integration ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- [x] **Strategy Module Decomposition**: 
  - âœ… **Applied Single Responsibility Principle** - Broke down large strategyEngine into focused modules
  - âœ… `strategy/converters/actionConverter.ts` - ActionType â†” StrategyAction conversions
  - âœ… `strategy/converters/cardConverter.ts` - Card value conversions for strategy lookup
  - âœ… `strategy/evaluators/hardHandEvaluator.ts` - Hard hand strategy evaluation
  - âœ… `strategy/evaluators/softHandEvaluator.ts` - Soft hand strategy evaluation  
  - âœ… `strategy/evaluators/pairEvaluator.ts` - Pair splitting strategy evaluation
  - âœ… `strategy/evaluators/alternativeActionFinder.ts` - Best alternative actions
  - âœ… `strategy/explanations/decisionExplainer.ts` - Strategy decision explanations
  - âœ… `strategy/coordinateCalculator.ts` - Strategy table coordinates for highlighting
  - âœ… `strategy/index.ts` - Clean public API
- [x] **Real-time Strategy Feedback**: 
  - âœ… **Game Integration** - Strategy evaluation integrated with all player actions
  - âœ… **Action Logging** - Every decision compared against optimal strategy
  - âœ… **Feedback Components** - StrategyFeedback component for real-time evaluation
- [x] **Strategy Table Highlighting**: 
  - âœ… **Interactive Tables** - StrategyTable component with cell highlighting
  - âœ… **Real-time Coordination** - Current game situation highlighted in strategy charts
  - âœ… **Enhanced StrategyGuide** - Complete strategy interface with tabs and feedback
- [ ] **Session Analytics**: Decision tracking and accuracy calculation

### Infrastructure Quality
- âœ… **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper Redux typing
- âœ… **Code Organization**: Clean directory structure following implementation plan
- âœ… **Theme System**: Custom blackjack colors and strategy action styling
- âœ… **Component Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns (layout/game/strategy)
- âœ… **Game Logic**: Complete blackjack rules implementation
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Clean compilation with only minor ESLint warnings

## Development Server Status âœ… RUNNING
The application is successfully running at `http://localhost:3000/blackjack-trainer`

### âœ… What's Working
1. **Complete Game Flow**: Deal â†’ Player Actions â†’ Dealer Turn â†’ Resolution
2. **Redux Integration**: All game state properly managed and updated
3. **UI Functionality**: Interactive buttons, real-time updates, proper state display
4. **Game Logic**: Accurate blackjack rules, hand calculations, and outcomes
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compilation with no errors
6. **Code Quality**: Clean verification with only minor unused variable warnings
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs with decisions, issues, and progress tracking
8. **VSCode Integration**: Verification tasks for reliable code quality checks
9. **ðŸ†• Strategy Engine Decomposition**: Modular, focused architecture following SRP
10. **ðŸ†• Clean API Design**: Public interfaces separate from implementation details
11. **ðŸ†• Real-time Strategy Feedback**: Every player action evaluated against optimal strategy
12. **ðŸ†• Interactive Strategy Tables**: Visual strategy guides with current situation highlighting
13. **ðŸ†• Strategy Integration**: Complete feedback loop between game actions and strategy evaluation


### ðŸš§ What's Next (Phase 3: Game Features & Polish)
1. **Split Action**: Implement pair splitting and multi-hand support
2. **Visual Improvements**: Card components with suits, animations, better styling
3. **Strategy Integration**: Real-time strategy feedback and table highlighting
4. **Session Tracking**: Statistics, game history, and learning analytics
5. **Advanced Features**: Bankroll management, different rule variations

### ðŸ“ˆ Ready for Phase 3
- **Core Gameplay**: Fully functional single-hand blackjack game
- **Foundation**: Solid Redux architecture ready for feature expansion  
- **Code Quality**: Clean TypeScript codebase with proper error handling
- **Development Experience**: Working dev server with hot reload
- **Documentation**: Complete architectural decisions and lessons learned
- **Verification Workflow**: VSCode tasks for reliable code quality assurance

## Development Notes
- **VSCode Tasks**: Use verification tasks (`Quick Verification`, `Verify Code Quality`) instead of `npm start` for code checking
- **Testing Strategy**: Ready for unit test implementation with solid foundation
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages configuration already set up
- **Documentation**: See `docs/decisions.md` and `docs/issues.md` for architectural decisions and lessons learned

## Files Created
- `docs/implementation-plan.md` - Comprehensive technical roadmap
- `docs/progress.md` - This progress tracking file

## Documentation Organization
All project documentation is organized in the `docs/` folder:
- **Specifications**: `functional-specifications.md`, `user-experience-specifications.md`, `minimal-requirements.md`
- **Development Guides**: `instructions.md`, `implementation-plan.md`
- **Progress Tracking**: `progress.md` (this file)
- **Future Documentation**: `decisions.md`, `issues.md`, `features.md` (to be created during development)

## Context Notes
- Emphasis on Redux reliability due to previous implementation challenges
- Focus on accessibility and responsive design from start
- GitHub Pages deployment requires specific package.json configuration
- Strategy evaluation and multi-hand splitting are most complex features requiring careful testing

## Blockers/Decisions Pending
None - ready to proceed with project initialization.
