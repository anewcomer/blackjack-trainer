## Development Issues Encountered (Project-Specific)

### TypeScript Import/Export Issues
**Problem**: Multiple TypeScript compilation errors due to incorrect imports and missing type definitions.

**Project-Specific Context**: Redux slice creation and action creator exports required careful dependency management.

**Solution Applied**: Used VSCode tasks `Quick Verification` and `Verify Code Quality` for systematic import cleanup.

### Redux Thunk Type Safety
**Problem**: Complex async thunks with proper TypeScript typing were challenging to implement correctly.

**Project-Specific Context**: Game flow thunks required coordination between multiple slices (game, session, ui) with proper type safety.

**Applied Solution**:
```typescript
export const gameThunk = () => (dispatch: AppDispatch, getState: () => RootState) => {
  // Game-specific thunk implementation with proper typing
};
```

### VSCode Task Integration
**Problem**: Initial attempts to use VS Code tasks for development workflow failed.

**Project-Specific Context**: Blackjack trainer development required frequent build verification due to complex Redux state management.

**Applied Solution**: Created discrete tasks for build, lint, type-check operations with dependency chaining.

### MUI v7 API Changes
**Problem**: MUI Grid layout caused compilation issues, requiring migration to Stack/Box components.

**Project-Specific Context**: Game layout required responsive design for card display and strategy tables.

**Applied Solution**:
```tsx
// Applied for blackjack game layout
<Stack spacing={2} direction="row">
  <Box>Game Area</Box>
  <Box>Strategy Guide</Box>
</Stack>
```

### Game State Management Complexity
**Problem**: Managing complex game state transitions with multiple hands, dealer automation, and action validation.

**Project-Specific Context**: Blackjack requires handling multiple player hands, split scenarios, and dealer automation with proper state synchronization.

**Applied Solution**:
1. Separated game logic into focused slices (game, session, ui)
2. Created utility functions for blackjack-specific calculations
3. Used thunks for coordinating multi-step game operations
4. Implemented action logging for blackjack strategy analysis

### Development Server Management
**Problem**: Long-running development server processes don't complete naturally and can interfere with task workflows.

**Project-Specific Context**: Blackjack trainer testing required frequent build verification rather than live server monitoring.

**Applied Solution**:
- Manual testing: `npm start` for interactive gameplay testing
- Automated verification: `npm run build && npm run lint && npm run type-check` for code quality
- Used VSCode tasks for repeatable blackjack-specific verification workflows

## Project-Specific Best Practices Applied

### Blackjack-Specific Redux Architecture
- Used typed hooks (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`) for game state management
- Kept reducers pure; used thunks for blackjack game flow side effects
- Structured slices by game domain (game, session, ui) for blackjack trainer features
- Used action creators consistently for blackjack game actions

### Blackjack Game TypeScript Integration
- Defined interfaces for blackjack game entities (Card, Hand, GameState) before implementation
- Used strict type checking for blackjack rules and strategy evaluation
- Imported card and game types explicitly when needed
- Avoided type assertions; fixed root type issues in game logic

### Blackjack Trainer Development Workflow
- Used VSCode tasks over manual terminal commands for blackjack-specific verification
- Applied verification tasks before committing blackjack game features
- Tested UI components with actual Redux integration for game state
- Updated documentation as blackjack features were implemented

### Blackjack Game Component Architecture
- Separated game layout, strategy logic, and session analytics components
- Used Material-UI v7 patterns for blackjack game interface
- Implemented responsive design for card display and strategy tables
- Kept components focused on single responsibilities (card display, action buttons, strategy tables)

### Blackjack Testing Success âœ…
**Achievement**: Successfully completed comprehensive Redux testing with 89 tests passing across 7 test suites for blackjack trainer functionality.

**Blackjack-Specific Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed Redux slice test structure to match blackjack game state interfaces (UIState properties)
- Resolved FeedbackMessage type mismatches by aligning tests with blackjack strategy feedback interfaces
- Fixed cardUtils test suite with proper suit symbols (â™ â™¥â™¦â™£) and Ace calculation logic for blackjack rules
- Resolved App component test multiple element issues using getAllByText for blackjack game elements

**Blackjack Project Results**:
- All Redux slice tests (game, session, ui) passing with proper TypeScript integration for blackjack state
- Complete utility function test coverage (cardUtils) for blackjack game logic
- Integration tests verifying Redux store architecture for blackjack trainer
- Zero TypeScript or ESLint errors across the blackjack trainer codebase

## Blackjack Project Problem Prevention

### Before Starting New Blackjack Features
1. **Plan Blackjack State**: Design interfaces for game entities (cards, hands, outcomes) and slice structure first
2. **Create Game Utilities**: Build blackjack logic utilities (card calculation, hand evaluation) before UI integration
3. **Set Up Game Verification**: Ensure build/lint tasks work for blackjack-specific components before adding complexity
4. **Test Game Incrementally**: Implement and test small blackjack features (single hand, then splits, etc.) rather than complete game flows

### When Encountering Blackjack Game Errors
1. **Check Game Compilation**: Use `Quick Verification` task first for blackjack component issues
2. **Isolate Game Issues**: Fix one type of error at a time (imports â†’ types â†’ game logic)
3. **Clean Game Code**: Remove unused imports and variables in blackjack components as you go
4. **Document Game Solutions**: Add patterns that work for blackjack development to project documentation

### Blackjack Code Quality Maintenance
1. **Regular Game Verification**: Run lint and type-check frequently during blackjack feature development
2. **Game Import Hygiene**: Clean up imports immediately when removing blackjack functionality
3. **Game Type Safety**: Never use `any` types for game entities; define proper Card, Hand, GameState interfaces
4. **Blackjack Error Handling**: Check for and handle edge cases in blackjack game logic (splits, blackjacks, busts)
