## Core Principles

### 1. Context Management is Critical

- **Maintain Comprehensive Documentation**: Keep detailed progress files updated between sessions
- **Structured Context Format**: Organize progress documents with clear sections:
  - Current phase/status
  - Completed work
  - In-progress tasks
  - Next steps
  - Blockers/decisions
  - Key files with descriptions
- **Refresh Context Regularly**: Begin new sessions by reviewing documentation
- **Document Architecture First**: Maintain detailed implementation plans before coding

**Performance Benefits**:
- **~90% faster** feedback during development
- **Immediate error detection** without full compilation
- **Reduced context switching** between terminal and editor
- **Better error context** with precise file and line information

### 2. Small, Focused Development Units

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file should have one clear purpose
- **Modular Architecture**: Decompose complex systems into focused modules
- **Progressive Implementation**: Build and test incrementally rather than all at once
- **Clear Component Boundaries**: Define interfaces before implementation

**Decomposition Pattern Example**:
```
// ❌ BAD: Large, multi-purpose file
engineModule.ts (500+ lines, multiple responsibilities)

// ✅ GOOD: Decomposed into focused modules
module/
├── evaluators/
│   ├── primaryEvaluator.ts    (handles primary logic)
│   ├── secondaryEvaluator.ts  (handles secondary logic)
│   └── specialEvaluator.ts    (handles special cases)
├── converters/
│   ├── inputConverter.ts      (input transformations)
│   └── outputConverter.ts     (output transformations)
├── explanations/
│   └── resultExplainer.ts     (generates explanations)
└── index.ts                   (clean public API)
```

### 3. Verification-Driven Development

- **Use AI Tools for Quick Feedback**: Leverage `get_errors` for immediate validation
- **Target Specific Files**: Check individual files rather than full compilation
- **Traditional Verification as Backup**: Use terminal commands for final validation
- **Fix Issues Incrementally**: Address one error type at a time

**Example Improved Workflow**:
```typescript
// 1. Make changes to components
// 2. Quick AI check: get_errors(["/path/to/modified/files"])
// 3. Fix any immediate issues
// 4. Continue development
// 5. Final verification: npm run lint && npm run type-check
```

## Effective GitHub Copilot Patterns

### For Project Planning

1. **Start with Architecture Design**
   - Have Copilot generate detailed implementation plans
   - Review and refine architectural decisions
   - Define clear modules and responsibilities
   - Establish type definitions and interfaces first

2. **Progressive Documentation**
   - Create structured documentation for each phase
   - Update progress documents after completing components
   - Document key decisions and trade-offs
   - Maintain a lessons learned document for universal insights

### For Code Generation

1. **Template-Based Generation**
   - Provide clear examples of your preferred coding style
   - Reference existing patterns when requesting new code
   - Define function signatures and return types before implementation
   - Be explicit about architectural requirements

2. **Incremental Code Building**
   - Generate skeleton structures first, then add details
   - Implement one feature at a time with specific guidance
   - Build utilities before UI components
   - Test core logic before integration

3. **Focused Component Development**
   - Describe component purpose and responsibilities clearly
   - Specify exact props and state requirements
   - Reference existing component patterns
   - Indicate performance considerations (memoization, etc.)

### TypeScript Development Patterns

1. **Import/Export Management**
   - Verify import statements when creating new files with dependencies
   - Clean up unused imports immediately to avoid warning noise
   - Use properly typed imports for better tree-shaking
   - Ensure all exports are properly defined and imported

2. **Type Safety Best Practices**
   - Use consistent type patterns throughout the application
   - Import modules individually rather than as namespace imports
   - Ensure type definitions match exactly between interfaces and implementation
   - Never use `any` types; define proper interfaces

3. **Complex Async Type Patterns**
   ```typescript
   // Consistent typing pattern example
   export const asyncOperation = () => (dispatch: AppDispatch, getState: () => RootState) => {
     // Implementation with proper typing
   };
   ```

### State Management Architecture

1. **Slice Organization**
   - Design state slices with clear separation of concerns
   - Use appropriate state normalization for complex data
   - Define clear interfaces for all state shapes
   - Document slice purpose and usage

2. **Async Actions**
   - Use async action patterns (thunks) for complex operations
   - Implement action logging for debugging complex state transitions
   - Test state transitions incrementally
   - Create utility functions for business logic calculations

3. **Redux Best Practices**
   - Prefer Redux Toolkit for consistent patterns
   - Implement proper selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Use immutable patterns for state updates
   - Leverage middleware for side effects

4. **Pattern Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Defining state shape
   interface GameState {
     status: 'idle' | 'active' | 'complete';
     // Additional state properties
   }
   
   // Creating a thunk with proper typing
   export const gameAction = (payload: PayloadType) => 
     async (dispatch: AppDispatch, getState: () => RootState) => {
       // Implementation with error handling
     };
   ```

### For Testing

1. **Integration-First Approach**
   - Start with integration tests to verify architecture
   - Move to unit tests for specific functions
   - Provide clear test examples for Copilot to follow
   - Specify test conventions and patterns

2. **Progressive Test Building**
   - Build test infrastructure before implementation
   - Create test helpers and utilities early
   - Define mock strategies and fixtures
   - Implement comprehensive test suites incrementally

3. **Testing Strategy Priorities**
   - **Unit Tests**: Redux slices, game logic, utility functions
   - **Component Tests**: React Testing Library for UI behavior
   - **Integration Tests**: Component + Redux interactions
   - **E2E Tests**: Only for scenarios requiring full browser context

4. **AI-Enhanced Testing Workflow**
   - Use AI error detection for immediate TypeScript/test validation
   - Fix test structure systematically using AI feedback
   - Resolve type mismatches by aligning tests with actual interfaces
   - Test expectations should match actual implementation properties

### For Debugging

1. **Clear Error Context**
   - Provide full error messages with stack traces
   - Describe the expected vs. actual behavior
   - Reference relevant code sections
   - Specify the steps to reproduce

2. **Systematic Resolution**
   - Address one error type at a time
   - Fix fundamental issues before symptoms
   - Document solutions for recurring problems
   - Use the "get_errors" tool repeatedly after changes

## Communication Preferences

### Effective Prompts

- **Be Specific and Detailed**: Provide comprehensive context in requests
- **Reference Existing Code**: Point to successful patterns
- **Explain Your Reasoning**: Share the "why" behind requirements
- **Set Clear Expectations**: Specify performance, style, or other requirements

### Request Formats

1. **For New Components**:
   ```
   Create a new [ComponentName] component that:
   - Handles [specific functionality]
   - Accepts props: [prop list with types]
   - Uses [specific patterns/hooks]
   - Follows the same style as [reference component]
   ```

2. **For Code Modifications**:
   ```
   Modify the [specific code section] in [file path] to:
   - Fix [specific issue]
   - Improve [specific aspect]
   - Follow [specific pattern]
   - Address [specific feedback]
   ```

3. **For Architecture Decisions**:
   ```
   Help me design an architecture for [feature] that:
   - Follows [specific principles]
   - Integrates with [existing systems]
   - Addresses [specific constraints]
   - Improves [specific aspects]
   ```

### Response Preferences

- **Concise Explanations**: Brief reasoning behind decisions
- **Code-First Responses**: Prioritize working code over lengthy explanations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with working basics, then refine
- **Clear Markers**: Use comments to highlight key decisions or areas needing attention

## Tool Usage Best Practices

### Preferred GitHub Copilot Tools

1. **`get_errors`**: For rapid development feedback
   - Check files after every significant change
   - Target specific files rather than full project
   - Fix errors incrementally by type
   - **~90% faster** feedback than traditional compilation

2. **`read_file`**: For understanding context
   - Read enough context to understand surrounding code
   - Focus on relevant sections
   - Read interfaces/types before implementation
   - Prefer reading larger ranges over many small reads

3. **`insert_edit_into_file`**: For precise code changes
   - Provide clear context markers (// ...existing code...)
   - Make minimal, focused changes
   - Follow existing code style
   - Respect existing code structure

4. **`replace_string_in_file`**: For targeted changes
   - Include 3-5 lines before/after for context
   - Make precise replacements
   - Preserve whitespace and indentation
   - Ensure patterns are unique enough to avoid unintended changes

5. **`run_in_terminal`**: For verification and builds
   - Use for final verification
   - Run test suites
   - Execute build processes
   - Install dependencies
   - Chain commands with && for sequential operations

### Tool Usage Patterns

- **Development Flow**: get_errors → insert_edit_into_file → get_errors
- **Investigation Flow**: read_file → semantic_search → grep_search
- **Verification Flow**: run_in_terminal → get_errors → insert_edit_into_file

### AI-Assisted Development Workflow

**Primary Workflow Strategy**:
- Use AI tools for rapid development feedback
- Target specific files for verification rather than full project
- Reserve terminal commands for final validation
- Apply consistent patterns across the codebase

**Note**: Always prefer terminal commands over IDE-specific tasks for better compatibility with GitHub Copilot. Terminal commands provide more direct control, visibility, and work consistently across all environments.

## Workspace Organization Preferences

- **Component Structure**: Group by feature, then by function
- **File Naming**: Clear, descriptive names with proper casing
- **Directory Organization**: Logical grouping of related files
- **Code Style**: Consistent formatting across the project
- **Import Order**: External libraries first, then internal modules

## Advanced Collaboration Techniques

### Context Continuity

1. **Session Handoffs**:
   - Update progress documents before ending sessions
   - Document current state and next steps
   - List any pending decisions or issues
   - Summarize recent changes

2. **Progressive Development**:
   - Complete one logical unit before moving to the next
   - Document completion of each phase
   - Create checklists for ongoing work
   - Track dependencies between components

### Challenging Scenarios

1. **Complex Refactoring**:
   - Break changes into smaller, incremental steps
   - Document the overall refactoring plan
   - Verify each step before proceeding
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage

2. **Architecture Evolution**:
   - Document design decisions and rationale
   - Create migration plans for significant changes
   - Implement changes gradually with verification
   - Update architecture documentation

## Recurring Problem Prevention Strategies

### Before Starting New Features
1. **Plan Architecture**: Design interfaces and module structure first
2. **Create Utilities**: Build core logic utilities before UI integration
3. **Set Up Verification**: Ensure build/test workflows work before adding complexity
4. **Test Incrementally**: Implement and test small pieces rather than complete features

### When Encountering Errors
1. **Use AI Tools First**: Leverage error detection tools for immediate feedback
2. **Isolate Issues**: Fix one type of error at a time (imports → types → logic)
3. **Clean Code**: Remove unused imports and variables as you go
4. **Document Solutions**: Add patterns that work to development documentation

### Code Quality Maintenance
1. **Regular Verification**: Run verification tools frequently during development
2. **Import Hygiene**: Clean up imports immediately when removing functionality
3. **Type Safety**: Never use `any` types; define proper interfaces
4. **Error Handling**: Check for and handle edge cases in core logic

## Library and Framework Adaptation

### Modern Framework Integration

1. **Version Migration Strategy**
   - Check current framework documentation for recommended patterns
   - Test UI components early to catch framework compatibility issues
   - Use modern component patterns rather than legacy approaches
   - Address breaking changes incrementally

2. **Framework Pattern Example**
   ```tsx
   // ✅ Modern component pattern
   <Stack spacing={2} direction="row">
     <Box>Content</Box>
   </Stack>
   
   // ❌ Legacy pattern (potential breaking changes)
   <Grid container spacing={2}>
     <Grid item>Content</Grid>
   </Grid>
   ```

3. **Library Integration Best Practices**
   - Import modules individually for better tree-shaking
   - Keep libraries updated but test thoroughly
   - Document library-specific patterns
   - Create abstraction layers for easier future migrations

4. **Framework-Specific Considerations**
   - React: Use functional components and hooks
   - TypeScript: Leverage strict type checking
   - Redux: Follow Redux Toolkit patterns
   - Testing: Prefer React Testing Library over Enzyme

## Continuous Improvement

- **Document New Patterns**: Add successful approaches to this guide
